#+TITLE: RAL project
* DNA
Given a sheet of paper with dots of radius 1.5cm,

1. Get the coords of the dots; (probably with Mindstorm's colour sensor)
2. Reconstruct the shape of [whatever caused the dots].

* Rover
Make...a rover.

* Spectro
A 1D version of the DNA project (so no, thanks).

* ISIS
(The microscope, not the organisation.)

Make a robot which:

1. Picks up an object (a *target*);
2. Puts it down in a (very) specific place.
